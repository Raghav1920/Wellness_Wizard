# Wellness_Wizard
Wellness Wizard, is an AI-powered health assistant designed to predict diseases and recommend medications. It uses four machine learning models—Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM—to analyze user input, and a CNN for medical image data like CT scans. After comparing the models based on accuracy, Random Forest was selected as the most effective. I published this research in the International Journal of Scientific Research in Engineering and Management. I’m currently developing a user-friendly website where users can securely access the tool, view their health history, and receive intelligent, personalized healthcare insights.
